            <h3>Bruce Lee</h3>
            
            <iframe width="400" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVgiu0p-qpU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>This was the movie that captivated Bruce Lee into the minds and hearts of every person with a tv set. It also debuted many things that would become the genre's defining attributes, like the animal sounds and highly choreographed scenes.</p>

            <h3>Jean Claude Van-Damme</h3>
            <p>
                I first saw JCVD, as he is commonly called, in Kickboxer. This is another classic. Especially for JCVD dance skills.

                I still get pumped up watching these scenes.

            <h3>Jackie Chan</h3>
            <p>
                I am not sure which was my first Jackie Chan movie: Armor of god or Project A but i would go on to devor most of his filmography. Here's a clip of the final fight scene from The Legend Of The Drunken Master

            <h3>Jet Li</h3>
            <p>
                This is the serious, fantastical martial arts. As a kid, he won various wushu competitions. He's played many chinese folk heros and legends. Here is a scene of his remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury.

            <h3>Donnie Yen</h3>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I never got the name Donnie Yen until I came to canada but I had seen him. First in Iron Monkey and then later in Flashpoint, which wins my recommendation for best fight scene ever filmed.
