            <p>I don’t remember how old I was when I first came across martial arts. I must have been when I was 12 or 13. What I remember clearly was the beauty of the man on screen, flashing kicks everywhere and easily dispatching his opponents. His name was Kurt Sloane. He was played by the eminent (Jean Claude Van-Damme; make anchor link to van-damme in famous martial artists page). Right there, I knew I had caught a bug I would never shake. Like the common cold, this bug would resurface periodically to plague me, but with pain and pleasure. Pain as I pushed myself to attain the beauty of Kurt Sloane and Bruce Lee. Pleasure when each passing day and week, I saw myself closer to that all-consuming beauty.</p>
        
            <p>I have to give special thanks to my mother. If not for her, my passion for the martial arts may never have taken hold. After all, the attention span of a kid is akin to that of a housefly. Not long after I watched Van-Damme play the legendary--and the best--Kurt Sloane, she enrolled me and my siblings in karate classes. 
            </p>

            <p>If I had to be honest, now that I am no longer blind with youth’s naivety, one of my senseis had no business teaching. If I had been older, he would have deterred me from martial arts. But I was young, eager and pulsing with hormones so nothing could have soured my daydreams. Not the classroom under no roof, the beer-belly teacher or the fact that nigeria(this world is a link to dambe martial arts page on wiki) was and is still not known for producing world class fighters.  
            </p>

            <p>Each day, I practiced from dusk to dawn, and some more after dawn. Each punch and kick I threw with the mental imagery of being the best, the one fighter at the top of a mountain of defeated opponents. Kinda like this:
            </p>
            <br>
        <div class="imgcontainer">
            <img class= "image" src="imgs/onapileofcorpses.jpeg" height="500px"> 
            <!--
            like that but without the guns. 
            Guns were for pussies. And still are.
            -->
        </div>
            <br>

            <p>This daydream continued for most of my teenage years. I grew stronger and so did it. I went from slow inflexible kicks to high kicks that scratched you in the blink of an eye--yeah, i was that fast. In addition to the physical transformations Karate bestowed me, I was also changed mentally. I experienced a new mental deftness and fortitude. I put in a work in school and excelled. Spiritually, I came upon martial artists like Bruce Lee, Mas Oyama and their philosophies of balance, strength and minimalism/essentialism. Perhaps it is this early interest that has lead to my renewed interest in minimalism/essentialism in all facets of life.
            </p>

            <p>Any blooded human after hearing my glowing testimonies on Karate may be skeptical of my claims. After all, I was only just a young boy and how can an art founded on principles of violence and destruction--so they say--be so morally and spiritually fulfilling. We’ll have to explore the history of Karate to understand its purpose and development.
